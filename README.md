# Campus Placement Analysis (MBA College)
In our project, we conducted an analysis of MBA college placements, considering factors such as class 10th and 12th marks, work experience, etc. We addressed outliers and performed encoding. Visualization of the data was carried out using seaborn and matplotlib. Data mining techniques, including Decision Trees, KNN, and Regression, were employed to assess the effectiveness of our analysis. This was a group project.

## Libraries used
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib

## About The Analysis
We have analysed the placment of student of a mba college using the data availabe. 
- Dimensionality reductio4
- Handling NaN value1
- Outlier Handlin
- Handling Categorical Data
- Classification Techniques
  - Decesion Tree
  - KNN
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
## Conclusion
- The problem of campus placement prediction can be solved with the help of different 
machine learningalgorithms.
- Here, the Logistic Regression Algorithm gave the highest accuracy (90%) for the campus placement prediction
- The selected features i.e. Gender, SSC percentage, HSC percentage, HSC Specialization, Degree Percentage, UG Degree Stream, Work Experience, E -test Percentage,
  Degree Specialization & Degree Percentage lead to higher classification accuracy.
